# RTL8721DM ↔ feeder board pin map (reverse-engineered)

The RTL-side GPIO assignments on the Petlibro mainboard (`PLNF301`), mapped live
on the real hardware with the [`firmware/rtl8721dm-pinmap`](../firmware/rtl8721dm-pinmap/)
GPIO explorer (custom firmware on the feeder's own RTL8721DM, driven over the
Pico bridge). This is the map the local read-collar → open-lid firmware will be
built against.

Confidence: **confirmed** = observed toggling/driving on the bench; *tentative* =
inferred from icon/role, not yet electrically proven.

## Pins (QFN68)

The RTL8721DM QFN68 bonds **34 GPIOs** (confirmed against datasheet Fig 2-3 and
the live chip). That's the entire I/O universe; 2 are the LOGUART, so **32 are
application-usable**, and the SoM breaks out ~29 of those as castellated pads.

```
Port A (18): 0  2  4  7  8  12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 25 26 27 28 30
Port B (16): 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  13 14 16 17 22 23 26 29 31
```

Access tiers in the GPIO explorer:
- **`PA_7` / `PA_8`** = LOGUART (the console) — skipped.
- **`PB_13/14/16/17`** = bonded, but not in the Arduino GPIO HAL pinmap
  (`gpio_init` faults) → read via the ROM `GPIO_ReadDataBit` (`rawscan` / `gread`
  / `watch`), no pull control available on these four.
- **the other 28** = full HAL access (`classify`/`scan`/`watch` with pull control).

(`PB_8..PB_12/15/18..21` etc. are NOT bonded — some are the internal MCM
SPI-flash pads; re-muxing them via `gpio_init` hangs XIP, so they're never
touched.)

### Front-panel capacitive-touch buttons — **confirmed**

Active-low momentary GPIO inputs (idle high, press → low). Likely the digital
outputs of an external cap-touch controller (the buttons are NOT on the RTL's
built-in TOUCH_KEY pins `PB_4–7`). Left → right across the panel:

| Pin | Icon | Function (tentative) |
|---|---|---|
| `PA_2` | circular arrows (rotate/refresh) | manual feed / dispense |
| `PA_4` | lid opening | manual lid open |
| `PA_0` | fork & knife | meal / feed |
| `PB_26` | padlock | panel lock / child-lock |

### RFID Modbus UART — **confirmed** (2026-06-14)

| Pin | Function | datasheet alt |
|---|---|---|
| `PA_26` | **RFID-UART TX** (RTL → module, the 8O1 command line) | UART / I2C0_SDA |
| `PA_25` | **RFID-UART RX** (module → RTL, the 8E1 reply line) | UART / I2C0_SCL |

Found by **signal injection** from the Pico bridge: the Pico taps both RFID nets
(GP4 = RTL→module command net, GP5 = module→RTL reply net). Driving each net
statically (`rfinject` on the bridge) and reading the RTL via `rawscan` gives a
clean 1:1 follow — **GP4 → `PA_26`**, **GP5 → `PA_25`** (each reads 1,0,1 tracking
the injected 1,0,1; the other reads 0,0,0). Harnesses:
`firmware/rtl8721dm-pinmap/tools/find_uart.py`, `confirm_uart.py`.

This corrects two earlier mistakes: the UART is **not** `PA_18/PA_19` (that was an
unproven guess), and `PA_25/PA_26` are the **UART, not I²C** — which is exactly why
the AW9523B I²C probing on those pins only ever produced artifacts (poking a UART
with I²C). The AW9523B's I²C, if reachable, is on the other I²C-capable pads.

`PA_25` (RFID-RX) is now the **definitive power detector**: a powered module idles
its TX high, so `PA_25` reads high (this is *proven* valid — master-mode received
framed Modbus replies on this net, which requires mark-idle).

### Other connected pins (from `classify`) — to be resolved

Driven pins seen in a no-tag, idle `classify` (so wired to *something*), function
names from the datasheet pin table:

| Pin | classify | datasheet alt | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PA_12` | LOW | KEY_ROW0 / ICFG0 | driven; role TBD |
| `PA_16` | LOW | KEY_ROW4 | KM0-driven (dynamic) |
| `PA_17` | LOW | KEY_ROW6 | driven; role TBD |
| `PA_27` | LOW | NORMAL_MODE_SEL strap | boot strap — ignore |
| `PA_28` | HIGH | PWM6 | candidate: motor PWM / LED |
| `PB_1`–`PB_6` | LOW | ADC_CH4/5/6, TOUCH/ADC0-2 | analog cluster — sensors? (read with `analogRead`) |
| `PB_7` | HIGH | TOUCH3 / ADC_CH3 | analog cluster |

## RFID module power / enable — **RESOLVED** (2026-06-14)

> **The RFID enable (PWEN) is AW9523B pin `P0_6` — an I2C GPIO-expander output,
> NOT a direct RTL GPIO.** That is why every RTL-pin trace failed (single, combo,
> opposite-bias, leave-one-out, and the forward/reverse PWEN injection): there is
> no RTL pin on the PWEN net to find — the RTL asserts it by writing the expander.

> - **Expander:** AW9523B, 7-bit addr 0x58–0x5B (ID reg 0x10 = 0x23).

**The RFID module is currently OFF.** Confirmed: with the RTL held in reset and
the Pico mastering the bus (`master on` + reads), the module is *completely
silent* — every register read returns no reply, a `0x0000..0x0040` sweep finds 0
base addresses (vs. a full tag dump in earlier sessions). The device is battery-
capable, so peripherals are power-gated; the always-on touch panel still works
(buttons found) but the RFID/sensors sit behind a gate the stock firmware
asserts and our custom firmware does not.

**Enable is NOT any accessible floating GPIO** (automated hunt, `out` verified
working). Driven individually *and* in combination, high *and* low, none of the
floating, drivable pins woke the module or any peripheral:
`PA_13, PA_14, PA_15, PA_18, PA_19, PA_26, PB_23`. Detection used a pulled-down
baseline (`scan down`) so a powered module's push-pull TX would clearly show;
nothing did. (`PA_18/PA_19` are the likely RFID **UART** pins — UART-capable and
floating — so they were kept undriven as detection pins.) Harnesses:
`firmware/rtl8721dm-pinmap/tools/probe_enable.py`, `probe_combo.py`;
`firmware/pico-bridge/tools/module_probe.py`.

**Update — the enable is NOT a simple RTL GPIO.** Following the "enables are
bias-resistor-held driven pins, not floating" insight, every *overridable* driven
pin was driven to the opposite of its bias, individually and all together, with
the UART-capable pins kept undriven as detectors (so a waking RFID TX couldn't be
masked): `PA_12/17/28, PB_1/2/5/7/22`. **Nothing woke** (`probe_driven.py`).

Crucially, some "driven" pins are **not** bias-held — they're *actively* driven by
another chip and won't override: driving `PB_4`/`PB_6` high leaves them reading
low, and `PB_29`/`PB_31` toggle on their own. Together with the working touch
panel, this points to an **always-on companion controller** that owns the touch
matrix (`PB_4/6`, the dynamic bus `PB_29/31`) and **gates the peripheral/RFID
power rail**. The RTL likely *requests* RFID power-on by messaging that controller
over the `PB_29/31` bus — there is no bare RTL pin to pull.

So: enabling the RFID from custom firmware is **not** "drive pin X high"; it needs
either (a) replaying whatever the RTL sends the companion controller, or (b) a
load-switch/PMIC path we haven't mapped.

**Most reliable next step:** reverse-engineer the stock firmware dump
(`flash_dump/`, with the `ghidra/` project) for the RFID bring-up — how it powers
the rail (a controller message on `PB_29/31`? an I2C/SPI write? a pin sequence we
couldn't reach?) and which UART carries the Modbus link. That gives the exact
mechanism directly; blind GPIO probing is now exhausted (all safely-drivable pins
tried, both polarities, single and combined). Also worth characterizing the
`PB_29/31` bus (protocol, peer) as the companion-controller interface.

### Update 2 (2026-06-14) — exhaustive GPIO + I2C probing, inconclusive

There is **no external companion controller** — the only other core is the
RTL8721DM's own **KM0** (our custom image runs the Arduino sketch on KM4 but only
Realtek's *default* KM0 firmware; the dynamic pins `PA_16/25`, `PB_29/31` are
KM0-driven). The RFID enable is one of the 34 bonded pins or an AW9523B output
(the AW9523B is an I2C GPIO/LED-matrix expander on the module, addr 0x58–0x5B).

Probed with `firmware/rtl8721dm-pinmap` (`probe_irq.py`, `probe_leaveout.py`,
`probe_excluded.py`, `i2c_*.py`):
- **No GPIO wakes the module.** Every safely-drivable pin and every excluded pin
  (`PB_3`, `PA_27`, the KM0 dynamics), single *and* all-at-once (leave-one-out),
  both polarities, with newly-HIGH (UART-RX idle) **and** newly-LOW (tag IRQ,
  tag-on-antenna) detection — nothing changed on any pin.
- **KM4 can't reliably reach the AW9523B I2C.** Hardware `Wire` (pinmux-locked to
  SDA=`PA_26`/SCL=`PA_25`) NACKs 0x58–0x5B (0/30 even with retries); bit-bang on
  the swapped assignment gave only **non-reproducible artifacts** (a phantom
  "0x28", a noisy 57-address scan) — consistent with KM0 actively using the bus.

**Conclusion:** the enable mechanism is almost certainly mediated by **KM0**
(which our build doesn't replicate and which contends for the relevant pins/bus),
so blind KM4-side probing can't isolate it. Decisive next steps, at the bench:
1. **Trace the module's enable pad → RTL pin** (one fact unblocks everything).
2. **Logic-analyzer capture during a *stock* power-on** (reflash the stock
   backup): shows KM0's exact AW9523B I2C transaction and/or the enable GPIO
   write. Then replay it from KM4 (and decide whether KM0 must be quieted).
3. Stock-firmware RE for the same, statically.

### Update 3 (2026-06-14) — it's a *disable*, not an *enable* (reset-default reframe)

Re-ran the hunt with the **proven** detector (`PA_25` = RFID-RX, pulled down so
module-off = 0, module-on = 1; `find_enable.py`, `find_enable_multi.py`,
`find_enable_opp.py`). Tested every safely-drivable pin **singly** (both
polarities), **all-high**, **all-low**, and **all-pins-driven-to-opposite-of-bias**
simultaneously (the true "assert every candidate enable at once" combo the uniform
sweeps miss). **`PA_25` never left 0** — no KM4 GPIO state powers the module.

The decisive observation that explains this: **in master mode the module was
powered and replying while the RTL was held in reset.** With the RTL in reset all
34 GPIOs sit at their hi-Z/default-pull state — yet the module ran. So the module
is **enabled by the reset-default pin state**, and it's our *custom firmware*
(Realtek default KM0 image + Arduino core init) that *disables* it. We've been
hunting an "enable to assert" when the reality is a "disable to undo," held by
something KM4 can't override at runtime (KM0, which owns the dynamic pins).

This reframes the fix as **firmware-level, not runtime GPIO toggling**:
- At the bench, the pad→pin trace still pinpoints the physical net.
- In firmware, the experiment is to keep the relevant pin(s) at their *reset
  default* through early boot (don't let KM0/core-init drive them), or to quiet/
  reflash KM0 — not to drive a pin high at runtime.
- The real end-goal path is to bring up an **RTL-side Modbus master on
  `PA_26`/`PA_25`** and use a genuine module reply as the (most robust) detector,
  toggling the candidate disable in early boot.

## Board subsystem map (2026-06-14)

Pad-level source of truth: `Docs/RTL8721DM_module_pinout.txt` (RTL ↔ castellated
pads + board function) and `Docs/AW9523B_pinout.txt` (expander). Key subsystems
for local **read-collar → open-lid**:

| Subsystem | Pins | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **RFID power (PWEN)** | AW9523B `P0_6` | confirmed — drive high powers the module |
| **RFID Modbus UART** | `PA_26` TX / `PA_25` RX | UART3, 19200, 8O1 cmd / 8E1 reply |
| **RFID tag-present IRQ** | `PA_16` | **active-low held level** (H = no tag, L = tag in field) — confirmed 2026-06-14; the clean presence signal |
| **Expander I²C (bit-bang)** | `PA_18` SDA / `PA_19` SCL | AW9523B @ 0x58 |
| **Lid / cover motor** | `PA_28` + `PA_30` | ✅ runs both directions (not spring-loaded). **Drive logic (2026-06-16): both pins LOW = STOP; one LOW + one HIGH/hi-Z = drive (dir set by which side); the driver reads hi-Z as ON, so a floating/input pin makes it CREEP — never leave these as input, hold both LOW to stop.** A (`PA_28` high / `PA_30` low) = **OPEN** (drives to the `PB_3`-dark end); B = **CLOSE** (`PB_4`-dark end). Closed-loop move validated 2026-06-16 (stop on the target detector going dark) — but **full duty overtravels into the hardstop**, so drive via **PWM** (`PA_28`=PWM6 / `PA_30`=PWM7, `pwm` cmd) for a slow approach. Stall/current shunt `PB_1` (ADC). |
| **Feed / dispense motor** | AW9523B `P0_2` + `P0_3` | expander outputs; shunt `PB_2` (ADC) |
| **Lid endstop photoelectrics** | **emitter `P0_4`** (expander); **detectors `PB_3` + `PB_4`** (RTL ADC) | ✅ 2026-06-16: `P0_4` high → `PB_3` lit (3928). Lid flag blocks ONE detector per endstop (`PB_4` dark at one end, `PB_3` dark at the other) = open/closed limits. Closed-loop: emitter on, drive until the target end's detector goes dark, then stop. |
| **Hopper + chute photoelectrics** | **emitter `P0_7`** (expander, "two groups"); detectors **hopper=`PA_17`** (digital, active-low), **chute=`PB_6`** (RTL ADC) | ✅ 2026-06-16: `P0_7` high → `PB_6` lit (3918); hopper+chute share the `P0_7` enable. (`PA_17` = hopper, **not** dispense — that was a wrong-connector read.) |
| **Dispense-rotor encoder** | **detector `PB_5`** (RTL ADC); emitter `P0_5`/`P0_7`; feed motor `P0_2`/`P0_3` (expander) | ✅ 2026-06-16: `PB_5` pulses `256↔3936` — **one pulse per rotor revolution** (single flag), and the geared feed motor turns slowly (one rev ≈ seconds; the 2 s spin saw <1 rev, the 8 s saw a pulse). **Count `PB_5` pulses = revolutions → measured dispensing** (drive feed motor until N revs, then stop). `PB_2` = feed current shunt (flat free-spinning, spikes on jam). |
| **Power sense (ADC)** | `PB_7` battery divider, `Vbat_meas` adapter divider | |
| **Audio amp** | `PB_22` (enable?), `PB_29`/`PB_31` (I²S/signal) | source of the earlier "static" |
| **Display con1** | `PA_2`/`PA_4`/`PA_0`, `PB_23`, `PB_26` | carries the touch-panel signals (the earlier "buttons") |
| **Display con2** | `PA_12` pwm / `PA_13` scl / `PA_14` sda_left / `PA_15` sda_right | Dot-matrix (TM16xx-style). **Bench-confirmed 2026-06-17** by driving the panel: data lines are `PA_14` & `PA_15` (adjacent), shared clock `PA_13`; `PA_12` carries the connector **PWM** — stock never drives it (display lights without it), function TBD. (`PA_16` was a guess here — it's actually the RFID IRQ, above.) |
| **Expander IRQ?** | `PA_27` | maybe AW9523B INT (its INTN reads unconnected though) |

## Still to find

- [x] **RFID-module enable / power-gate** — **AW9523B `P0_6`** via bit-bang I2C on
      `PA_18`/`PA_19` (see RESOLVED note above; `tools/aw9523_pwen.py`).
- [x] **RFID-module UART** on the RTL side — **`PA_26` = TX, `PA_25` = RX**
      (confirmed by injection, 2026-06-14; see the RFID UART section).
- [x] **Tag-ready IRQ** — `PA_16`, active-low held level (confirmed 2026-06-14).
- [x] **Lid motor** — `PA_28`/`PA_30` H-bridge (confirmed both directions + endstops 2026-06-14).
- [~] **Lid position / limit sensors** — cover photoelectric on `PB_3`/expander
      `P0_4`/`P0_5`; **emitter (`P0_7`/`PB_4`) must be powered to read them** — still
      to characterize the on-state values vs lid position.
- [ ] **Analog sensors** on `PB_1–PB_7` (lid/feed current shunts `PB_1`/`PB_2`,
      battery `PB_7` — `analogRead`; food-level photoelectric `PA_17`).
- [ ] Confirm the button functions against actual behaviour.

## Method

Flash the GPIO explorer, then on the bridge monitor: `classify` to find driven
pins, `watch` while actuating one thing at a time to bind a signal to a pin, and
careful `out` probing to find outputs. Recover from any fault with `reset` on the
bridge CDC1.
